# Requirements Gathering

## Methods Used

We primarily used a survey and got about 10 responses. We used a survey as we felt it was easy enough to get out and wouldn't take too much of the users time. This allowed our users to quickly fill something out and get it back to us. In addition to the survey we also had drafted interview questions. However, we did not actually end up using them as we felt the survey gathered a good bit of what we needed to know. Though, we may decide to interview the users if we feel necessary.

## Findings

We found a few things interesting. The first was that most people were pretty distributed on the bars they liked, Riley's had the most votes (3/10) though all the answers were pretty all over the place. There was even a mention for Applebee's which I never would've thought someone would go for.

In addition to that we found that a 60% of people were looking for a happy hour deal at least once a week. This was good to know because it solidifies the need for a way to find happy hour deals. Even better it seemed there was no clear answer to looking for happy hour deals, some said google and others said friends but there was certainly not a one shoe fits all here.

A few more things we learned were that 60% of people were looking for night deals and the other 40% were looking for morning and night, though nobody was looking for only morning deals. We also found that most users wanted a college bar (70%) while the other users wanted a brewery. This was interesting as there were 5 options here though nobody cared for the other 3.

Finally, we learned a bit more about the types of deals our users care the most about. The number one answer was pitchers with 4 responses, otherwise it seemed most users had their own personal deals they care about. That means our app will need to appeal to a wide range of deals not just the most popular.

## Conclusions

The data certainly confirms the necessity for an app that looks for happy hour deals. Users did not have one good way to find these deals and their deal wants were rather specific. Given that we will likely need a new story for some of these deals (Wings, BOGO, etc).

We will also need to create a story of someone looking for morning deals, as there seems to be some users that will be using the app for both morning and night deals.

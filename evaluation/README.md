# Usability Evaluation

## Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthroughs

Our findings were pretty much what we thought we would see. Most users had no issues using the application and would use the app if it were to be finished. One surprising finding was that the search bar was not as clear as users would like. Instead of searching for a restaurant, or bar from the search bar users would like something more like a filter button. IE filter to bars or restaurants only and search for a specific restaurant name from the bar. Other than that we found users mostly content with the apps.

Below, you can see the protocol evaluation we used and a link to the finished prototype we used.

## Protocol Evaluation & Our Approach To The Study

The evaluation was a simple two-task, exercise with a few background questions. Users were told to **think-aloud** and let us know what they were thinking about their experience. The background questions simply asked about how each person found deals before, what their priorities were, and if there were any features they would've liked to have had. With these questions, we had hoped to find some things we could implement in the future and ensure our application was doing what we sought to do.

Next was task 1. Here we asked the user to find a deal for a restaurant. We noted a few things, if the user found a deal for a restaurant and if they used the search bar or not. This helped us to see if the search bar would function how we had hoped as the method to look up specific categories.

Then the users embarked on task 2. This task was to have a user favorite a bar, and click where they would go to see this favorite. Simply put we wanted to see if the favorite feature was efficient for the user. We noted how hard the task was on a 1-5 scale (5 being the easiest), and if they completed it.

Finally, were the review questions. These asked what the users liked the most, least, what they felt was missing, and any additional thoughts. This was one of the most critical parts as we were able to find out what we were doing right and what we were doing wrong.

By using the think-aloud approach for these walkthroughs we were able to understand how a user may get lost and where they would think to look. This helped us to understand a bit more about the natural navigation of a user. Overall this worked great and was really informative for us.

## Data Evaluation & Interpretation

Overall the data made a few things very clear. First, the search bar was not what the users would like to use when looking for broad categories like Restaurants or Bars. Instead, the users would like a filter option or something similar. It was also made clear that while most people did correctly choose the search bar it was only the first choice about 40% of the time. To fix this I think the easiest way would be to include a filter option to filter based on categories rather than using the search bar for that.

Another note from one user was that they would like the dates for all bars to change. IE if you wanted a Wednesday deal you should select Wednesday once and all bars or restaurants will switch to Wednesday deals. This is an easy fix but just syncing up all the locations with the switch on one restaurant.

When looking at the data for the favorites bar, this worked quite well actually. All users correctly chose to favorite one restaurant or bar and then clicked on the favorites bar. In addition, users found this easy with 4/5s of users giving it a 5, while the other 1/5 gave it a 4. This meant the favorites bar was accomplishing exactly what we had hoped it to.

Finally, there were two more notes to address. One user wanted a radius feature to see how far a bar is from you at any time. This could be accomplished by having a simple GPS feature and displaying your current distance from each place. The other note was about ratings. This could be implemented by allowing users to rate a bar or restaurant on a 1-5 star system and display those stars.

Overall, this data showed us while we were doing the basic functions correctly and people liked the app we will need to implement some more features and clean up the UI a bit for users. We were glad to see the favorites bar was a hit and that most users also liked the first opening page.

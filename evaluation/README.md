# Usability Evaluation

## Hueristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthroughs

Our findings were pretty much what we thought we would see. Most users had no issues using the application and would use the app if it were to be finished. One surprising finding was that the search bar was not as clear as users would like. Instead of searching for restaurant, or bar from the search bar users would like something more like a filter button. IE filter to bars or restaurants only and search for a specific restaurant name from the bar. Other than that we found users mostly content with the apps.

Below you can see the protocol evaluation we used, along with a link to the finished prototype we used..

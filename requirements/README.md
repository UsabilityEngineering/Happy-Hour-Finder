# Requirements Gathering

## Methods Used

We primarily used a survey and got about 10 responses. We used a survey as we felt it was easy enough to get out and wouldn't take too much of the users time. This allowed our users to quickly fill something out and get it back to us. In addition to the survey we also had drafted interview questions. However, we did not actually end up using them as we felt the survey gathered a good bit of what we needed to know. Though, we may decide to interview the users if we feel necessary.

## Findings

We found a few things interesting. The first was that most people were pretty distributed on the bars they liked, Riley's had the most votes (3/10) though all the answers were pretty all over the place. There was even a mention for Applebee's which I never would've thought someone would go for.

In addition to that we found that a 60% of people were looking for a happy hour deal at least once a week. This was good to know because it solidifies the need for a way to find happy hour deals. Even better it seemed there was no clear answer to looking for happy hour deals, some said google and others said friends but there was certainly not a one shoe fits all here.

A few more things we learned were that 60% of people were looking for night deals and the other 40% were looking for morning and night, though nobody was looking for only morning deals. We also found that most users wanted a college bar (70%) while the other users wanted a brewery. This was interesting as there were 5 options here though nobody cared for the other 3.

Finally, we learned a bit more about the types of deals our users care the most about. The number one answer was pitchers with 4 responses, otherwise it seemed most users had their own personal deals they care about. That means our app will need to appeal to a wide range of deals not just the most popular.

## Conclusions

The data certainly confirms the necessity for an app that looks for happy hour deals. Users did not have one good way to find these deals and their deal wants were rather specific. Given that we will likely need a new story for some of these deals (Wings, BOGO, etc).

We will also need to create a story of someone looking for morning deals, as there seems to be some users that will be using the app for both morning and night deals.

## Caveats

This data is if not entirely, then almost entirely college students. This misses a significant portion of adults that will likely want to use our app. On top of that more responses will probably be needed and an interview or two to really understand why some people are choosing their bars. 

## Personas

Based on the findings of our survey we found three standout personas. 

#### Davis 

20 year old male in Chico, Ca 

Full Time student and part-time worker

Persuing a Bacholers Degree in Computer Animation and Game Design

Davis enjoys his part-time job working from home. He doesn't leave the house to often being busy with work and class, however loves to eat out for dinner. Lives in a four bedroom apartment with roommates getting the same degree. 

He loves to get chicken wings and burgers with his roommates and friends. But always misses out on deals to save money or let his friends know about upcoming deals. 

Goals: 

 * Be able to know what deals are coming up 
 * Wants to save money when eating out
 * Be able to share deals with friends

### Samantha

21 year old female in Chico, Ca

Full Time student

Persuing a Bacholers Degree in Women Studies, thinking about applying to a Graduate Program

Samantha loves going to class and having fun outside of school. 

Samantha enjoys going to the bars with her friends and having a fun night out. She enjoys saving a few bucks with the happy hour deals. Currently goes to Riley's bar for "Pitchers" every friday night but wants to branch out. She had a bad experince at Riley's a few nights ago and wants a safe place to drink at with friends. 

Goals:

 * Find bars with similar deals
 * Wants a bar with a simiar enviorment to Riley's
 * Finding a safe bar to drink with friends

### Ryan

23 year old male in Chico, Ca

B.A. in Accounting

Accountant for a country club

Ryan just graduated from school and was lucky enough to find a job in his college town. He is tired of the drinking scene and wants to branch out and do activites with his friends. 

He currently goes to Riley's bar with his friends, but wants to do more. He has become tired of just drinking and talking, "I want to be able to do a fun activity while having a few beers with my buddies."

Goals:
 
 * Find bars with triva night
 * Finding places like a puzzle room or hatchet throwing
 * Branching out from a normal routine

The first persona was someone looking exclusively for deals on food. The top food results were for Burgers and Brew, Wing Stop and Applebee’s. These participants stated that BOGO deals and 60 cent wings were their favorite. The second persona we found was someone looking for exclusively for deals on drinks. Most participants said Riley’s Bar was the bar they were looking to find deals on drinks at also stating that “pitchers night” was their favorite. The third category is someone looking for food, drink and entertainment. The participant that wanted this result stated that food, drink and trivia night was their favorite deal. 

All three of the personas were consistent in the resources they used to find happy hour deals, using Google or their friends. A large percentage of our participants were looking for deals at college bars, which is a good indication that all three personas were college age adults (18-24). 

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1:

Davis just got done with his shift from work and wants to go out to eat. He ask his roommates if they know of any deals around for wings, but they dont know any. He thinks to himself, "it would be a waste to go to wingstop and find out Buffalo wild wings had a deal". He wonders how he would be able to know without calling both places

### Scenario 2:

Samantha just got a text from her friends wondering if she wants to go out. She thinks to herself, "I want to go out but I don't really wanna be at Riley's the floor is too sticky, but the drinks are cheap". Samantha asks her friend if she knows any bars other than Riley's with a good deal on drinks tonight, her friend replies with "Crazy horse has buck night tonight but I don't know what time it starts or ends at". 

### Scenatio 3: 

Ryan just got home from his job and wants to hang out with his friends. He is trying to find a place with a fun triva night but only finds posters for last years trivia night. He wants to go get drinks with his friends and do an activity so something like hatchet house is out the window. He thinks to himself, "What bars have a triva night soon?".
